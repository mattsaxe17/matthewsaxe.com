Hello! My name is Matt and I have many passions. I love to workout, try new foods, and learn about new tech. One of those passions, though, is creating fast, beautiful, and sometimes complex software. From websites to FitBit watch faces, I love to test my skills and create something amazing. It all started in 11th grade, where I taught myself HTML and CSS in study hall!

Nowadays, I work as a programmer and a freelance software engineer where I aim to build incredible websites for clients. My experience extends from front-end design to servers and databases, and I love a challenge. Check out my <m-link new-tab href="https://github.com/mattsaxe17">Github</m-link> to see what I'm up to!

I love to discuss cryptocurrency, blockchain, data structures, NFTs, and anything software. Reach out however you'de like - I'd love to talk.
